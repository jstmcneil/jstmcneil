Hello there! My name is Jake McNeil, and I'm a developer turned Cybersecurity consultant. My primary interests include 
Cloud Security, DevSecOps, and Application Security are pursued through personal research, enterprise work, and university 
& certificate curricula. 

- 🌱 &nbsp;&nbsp; Currently finishing up my Master in Information Security at Georgia Tech. To find more about this 
program, please refer to this link [here.](https://www.gatech.edu/academics/degrees/masters/cybersecurity-ms-cybersecurity)
- 🔭  &nbsp;&nbsp; At this time, I'm exploring binary exploitation in x86! My expertise mostly lies in ELF binaries, but I am looking
to expand into Windows PE. Past that, I'm doing research into the security applications of OpenAI! I even have a few cool demos.
- 📫  &nbsp;&nbsp; Take a look at my website! It should list my contact info & recent endeavours: *[jstmcneil.github.io](jstmcneil.github.io)*

Thank you for reading & be kind to each other. :)
